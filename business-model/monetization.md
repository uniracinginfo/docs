# ðŸ’° Monetization

#### Our model can be  from UNIRACING's operating activities including:

* Transaction fees incured from in-game market and multi-marketplaces
* In-game activities fees
* Betting fees

Fees are applied on the platform for every transaction and the size of the fee depends on the form of transactions. We would take a small fee from all transactions on the platform: NFT cars sales, races, bets, deposits, etc.

* Advertisements income

In our game, users have to watch video advertisement in exchange for rewards or tokens. Thus, we have income from paid promotions from bookings of clients or advertisements of our project
