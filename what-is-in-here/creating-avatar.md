# ðŸ‘½ Creating avatar

Prior to joining **UNI Racing** City, players will be able to customize their avatar and personal character based on their preferences.&#x20;

In this virtual city, this avatar persona will be their representation. Players can then freely wander around the city and communicate with one another via chat and voice chat. Players can also use a sequence of motion deviations to depict their characterâ€™s emotions and behaviors. Uni Racing City plans to develop goods employing virtual reality glasses in the future, making it easier for users to interact and entertain in the metaverse.
