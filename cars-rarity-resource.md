# â„¹ Cars Rarity Resource

**UNIRACING** cars have a **variable rarity** as opposed to a fixed rarity. Your actions in the game, such as upgrades, color changes, will influence the rarity value of your car. This **rarity value** will be available once the game officially starts and will change automatically depending on your actions.We are however able to calculate a **First Drop Rarity** value based on fixed numbers in each series, as each series contains **5000** cars spread over **25** car models. As each car model contains **7 Factory Classes** we can also include that calculation into the FDR.After the drop is completed we can also include the **Car Color** into the formula, however since colors are being announced at each drop separately, this calculation has to wait until the whole Collection has been published.Looking for **CW** Rarity? Check out the FDR list at the bottom of this page.
