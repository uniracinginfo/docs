# 🏎 Car Assets

### **Cars form the core asset of the game** &#x20;

Cars are required to play the game. Players have toy cars from the verified **UNIRACING** Car Collection on the Marketplace.

From time to time new cars will be released (or dropped). The first set of cars released is the Genesis Collection, consisting of **5000** cars.  During the drops, a variety of cars in different Car Classes are released.

### Car Value

Cars have value from two perspectives: rarity and in-game attributes. Rarity is derived from the model and color of the car, its position and number in the release, and the collection it is in.&#x20;

Cars can be bought and sold, and when they are sold, any upgrades that were purchased are also sold with the car.
