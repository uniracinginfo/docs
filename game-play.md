# ðŸŽ® Game Play

Playing the game consists of buying a car, buy gas for your car, selecting a race, choosing your race strategy, and viewing the results. The races happen in the background and are determined primarily by the racer's strategy, and secondarily by a weighted random algorithm. Cars with higher XP and upgrades have an advantage, but players with the best Race Strategies have the ultimate advantage. To play racers you first need to buy a car and need data analysis for race.

### **Buy Gas**

In order to enter a race, you must first buy enough gas. Gas is purchased in virtual gallons, with each gallon costing about $1 USD. All purchases and winnings in the game are paid in $~~RAFI~~RACEFI tokens, but costs are quoted in USD to maximize ease of understanding and to maintain consistent prices. All races are shown as "1 GAL" or "5 GAL" races. This means that you will need 1 gallon of gas to enter a "1 GAL" race.

### Selecting a Race

First make sure that you have a car selected (you will see it in the top navigation bar). To select a car go to your garage and choose the car you want to race. Races happen on select tracks by Car Class. Now that you have a car selected, you can choose to view upcoming races by all classes, by your car's eligible races, or by racetrack. Once you choose a race and click to enter it, you will enter your strategy.

### **Choose Your Race Strategy**

At this point you will see the Race Conditions, important information that will inform and influence your strategy. Race Conditions include weather, track conditions, pit conditions, and fan sentiment. With this information you will choose your Race Strategy. Components of Race Strategy include: Race Posture, Engine Strategy, Tires to use, Racing Line, Breaking Technique, and Pit strategy. If your car does not have the upgraded tires you may have to choose tires that are not optimal for the Race Conditions.

From here the race starts and happens in the background. Depending on how well you have matched a winning Race Strategy against the Race Conditions, and your level of XP and upgrades, determines whether or not you win the race.

Over time racers will learn what strategies work best for what conditions. However, racers are cautioned to think that learning a few strategies will allow them to win every race. There are over 3,000 potential combinations of Race Conditions and over 1,000 potential combinations of Race Strategies. And the game will not stay static, as twists and turns will be added to the game over time.

### **Race Results**

At the conclusion of the race, about five minutes (this is a virtual race after all), the top three winners in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place are revealed. Also presented is a summary of what happened during the race. You might find that one of the racers blew a tire, crashed, or slid off the track.

_Cars that crash during a race will have to be repaired and will not be able to race for two to six hours. However, if a car owner is also a **Land Baron** (owns Racetrack Land), their cars are immediately repaired and will be able to race without waiting for repairs. This is due to the benefit of owning Racetrack Land that results in the best Pit Crews._

When entering a race, players are presented with the weather, track, and race conditions. With this in mind, players select from several options that make up their strategy to compete in the race. The race then happens in the background. Results of the race are determined primarily by how well each racer's strategy played out and by a weighted random algorithm. Cars with higher XP and upgrades have an advantage in the race.
