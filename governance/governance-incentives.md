# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’¼ Governance incentives

It is the community members which would maintain and drive development of **UNIRACING**, so $**UNI** incentives would need to be distributed to promote enthusiasm for community governance, increase community activity, and compensate them for their time, expertise and effort. Only users who have participated in submission of proposals, commenting, reviewing and/or voting will be entitled to receive $**UNI** token governance rewards.
